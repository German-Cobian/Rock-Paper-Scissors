# "Rock-Paper-Scissors"

A simple implementation of the grade-school classic ‚Äúrock paper scissors‚Äù game. If you don‚Äôt know what that is check the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors). The game plays against the computer, which will randomly return either ‚ÄòRock‚Äô, ‚ÄòPaper‚Äô or ‚ÄòScissors‚Äô.

The files `rock_paper_scissors.html`, `rock_paper_scissors.x5html` and `rock_paper_scissors_loop.html` are versions of the game that can be played by inputting the player's choices into pop-up windows and seeing the outcomes in the developer's tools window.

Only the file `rock_paper_scissors2.html` consists of a version of the game that can be played fully on the web browser.
